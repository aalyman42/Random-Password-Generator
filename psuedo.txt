I need to allow users to choose a password length between 8 and 128 with a prompt

I need to use confirms to allow users to select which arrays to use in password.

I need to combine arrays into one common array

from the common array, i need to select random values for a new array that is the length of the user's chosen length.

I need to change the array from line 14 into a string value

i need to display the string value into the "your secure password" box

var optionPossibilities [array]
var optionCombo [array length = password length]
var yourPassword "String of optionCombo[array]"
